# GuffGaff-Hub - Realtime Chat Application

## Introduction

GuffGaff Hub is a messaging app that keeps your messages super safe. It looks nice with React and Tailwind CSS on the front part, and it runs securely on the backend with Spring Boot (JAVA). Your login is extra secure using JWT. What's cool is that we added AES encryption to make sure your messages are private. Plus, you can share images smoothly thanks to Cloudinary. It's a friendly and secure place for your chats!
