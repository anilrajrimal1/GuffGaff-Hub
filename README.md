# Realtime Chat Application

## Introduction

Welcome to the Realtime Chat Application! This project is a full-fledged messaging application with a user interface inspired by WhatsApp. It enables users to exchange messages individually or within groups, view user statuses, and supports image uploading. The project utilizes React for the frontend with Tailwind CSS for styling, and the backend is powered by Spring Boot, ensuring secure login using Spring Security with JWT-based authentication.
